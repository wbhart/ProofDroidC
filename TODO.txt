Critical:

* Split iff targets

* Allow user to enter hypotheses and targets manually

* Modify parser error to show position in string where error occurs with arrow pointing

* Add reasons for hyps and tars

* Display reasons

Noncritical:

* print/parse \not\subseteq and \not\leq (the latter can't be made into > in general,
  e.g. partial orders), and \neg(A \subseteq B), \neg(a \leq b), etc. Must internally
  canonicalise to \neg(blah) for negated literal purposes for resolution

* Helpful error messages in parser (i.e. rules corresponding to non-matching inputs)

Maybe:
