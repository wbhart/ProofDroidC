Critical:

* Separate APPLICATION into FUNCTION and PREDICATE

* Separare BINARY_OP into BINARY_OP and BINARY_PREDICATE

* Separate UNARY_OP into UNARY_OP and UNARY_PREDICATE

Noncritical:

  e.g. partial orders), and \neg(A \subseteq B), \neg(a \leq b), etc. Must internally
  canonicalise to \neg(blah) for negated literal purposes for resolution

Maybe:
